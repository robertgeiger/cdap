File Sets
=========

A Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) example demonstrating the FileSet dataset and its
use in services and MapReduce.

Overview
========

This application demonstrates the use of the FileSet dataset:

  - The ``lines`` FileSet is used as input for the ``WordCount`` MapReduce program.
  - The ``counts`` FileSet is used as output for the ``WordCount`` MapReduce program.
  - The ``FileSetService`` allows uploading and downloading files within these two file sets.

Let's look at some of these components, and then run the application and see the results.

The FileSetExample Application
------------------------------

As in the other :ref:`examples <examples-index>`, the components
of the application are tied together by the class ``FileSetExample``:

.. literalinclude:: /../../../cdap-examples/FileSetExample/src/main/java/co/cask/cdap/examples/fileset/FileSetExample.java
    :language: java
    :lines: 33-

The ``configure()`` method creates the two FileSet datasets used in this example. For the first
FileSet |---| ``lines`` |---| we specify an explicit base path; for the second FileSet
|---| ``counts`` |---| we let CDAP generate a path. Also, we configure the output format
to use ``":"`` as the separator for the ``counts`` FileSet.

We will use the ``FileSetService`` to upload a file into the ``lines`` file set, then count the words in
that file using MapReduce, and finally download the word counts from the ``counts`` file set.

FileSetService
--------------

This service has two handler methods: one to upload and another to download a file.
It declares the datasets that it needs to access using ``@UseDataSet`` annotations:

.. literalinclude:: /../../../cdap-examples/FileSetExample/src/main/java/co/cask/cdap/examples/fileset/FileSetService.java
    :language: java
    :lines: 65-69
    :dedent: 4

Both methods of this service have two arguments: the name of the FileSet and the relative path within that FileSet.
For example, the ``read`` method returns the contents of the requested file for a GET request:

.. literalinclude:: /../../../cdap-examples/FileSetExample/src/main/java/co/cask/cdap/examples/fileset/FileSetService.java
    :language: java
    :lines: 71-93
    :dedent: 4

It uses the ``getLocation()`` of the file set to obtain the location representing the requested file,
and then opens an input stream for that location. ``Location`` is a file system abstraction from
`Apache™ Twill® <http://twill.incubator.apache.org>`__; you can read more about its interface in the
`Apache Twill Javadocs <http://twill.incubator.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/twill/filesystem/Location.html>`__.


MapReduce over Files
====================

``WordCount`` is a simple word counting implementation in MapReduce. It reads its input from the
``lines`` FileSet and writes its output to the ``counts`` FileSet:

.. literalinclude:: /../../../cdap-examples/FileSetExample/src/main/java/co/cask/cdap/examples/fileset/WordCount.java
    :language: java
    :lines: 39-55

It is worth mentioning that nothing in ``WordCount`` is specifically programmed to use a FileSet. Instead of
``lines`` and ``counts``, it could use any other dataset as long as the key and value types match.

Running the Example
===================

Starting the Service
--------------------

Once the application is deployed:

- Go to the *FileSetExample* `application overview page 
  <http://localhost:9999/ns/default/apps/FileSetExample/overview/status>`__,
  click ``FileSetService`` to get to the service detail page, then click the *Start* button; or

- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface::

    $ cdap-cli.sh start service FileSetExample.FileSetService
 

Uploading and Downloading Files
-------------------------------
First we will upload a text file that we will use as input for the WordCount.
This is done by making a RESTful call to the ``FileSetService``.
A sample text file is included in the ``resources`` directory of the example::

  $ curl -w'\n' localhost:10000/v3/namespaces/default/apps/FileSetExample/services/FileSetService/methods/lines?path=some.txt \
    -X PUT --data-binary @examples/FileSetExample/resources/lines.txt

Now we start the MapReduce program and configure it to use this file as its input, and to write its output to
``counts.out``::

  $ curl -w'\n' localhost:10000/v3/namespaces/default/apps/FileSetExample/mapreduce/WordCount/start \
    -d '{ "dataset.lines.input.paths": "some.txt", "dataset.counts.output.path": "counts.out" }'

Wait for the MapReduce program to finish, and you can download the results of the computation::

  $ curl -w'\n' localhost:10000/v3/namespaces/default/apps/FileSetExample/services/FileSetService/methods/counts?path=counts.out/part-r-00000

Note that we have to download a part file that is under the output path that was specified for the MapReduce program.
This is because in MapReduce, every reducer writes a separate part file into the output directory.
In this case, as we have fixed the number of reducers to one, there is only a single part file to download.


Stopping and Removing the Application
=====================================
Once done, you can stop the application as described in :ref:`Stopping an Application 
<cdap-building-running-stopping>`. Here is an example-specific description of the steps:

**Stopping the Service**

- Go to the *FileSetExample* `application overview page 
  <http://localhost:9999/ns/default/apps/FileSetExample/overview/status>`__,
  click ``FileSetService`` to get to the service detail page, then click the *Stop* button; or
- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface::

    $ cdap-cli.sh stop service FileSetExample.FileSetService   
    Successfully stopped service 'FileSetService' of application 'FileSetExample'

**Removing the Application**

You can now remove the application as described in :ref:`Removing an Application <cdap-building-running-removing>`, or:

- Go to the *FileSetExample* `application overview page 
  <http://localhost:9999/ns/default/apps/FileSetExample/overview/status>`__,
  click the *Actions* menu on the right side and select *Manage* to go to the Management pane for the application,
  then click the *Actions* menu on the right side and select *Delete* to delete the application; or
- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface::

    $ cdap-cli.sh delete app FileSetExample
